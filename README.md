# Touhou-Bad-Apple
Touhou is a piece of internet history. It's been intertwined with early internet stuff with memes and some banger songs with their remixes. For me Touhou presents a strange nostalgic feeling taking me back to 2009 when I first got a new PC. In my family I was the one who spent the most time on it, it's a feeling that I don't think can ever be replicated.
I am completing my CSE degree now and building this application is my duty towards the Touhou community. I'd feel like something was incomplete if I did not make this.
